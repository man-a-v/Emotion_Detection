# Face Emotion Detection with Streamlit

## Overview

This project allows for real-time face emotion detection. The application utilizes the Haar Cascade classifier for face detection and a transfer-learned ImageNet model trained on the FER 2013 dataset for facial emotion classification.

## Features

- **Streamlit Web Interface**: The application provides a seamless and interactive user experience through the Streamlit framework.

- **Face Detection**: Haar Cascade classifier is employed to detect faces in real-time from the webcam feed.

- **Emotion Classification**: A transfer-learned ImageNet model, trained on the FER 2013 dataset, is used for accurate emotion classification.

- **Real-Time Updates**: Emotion predictions are dynamically updated and displayed on the Streamlit app, providing instant feedback on detected facial expressions.
